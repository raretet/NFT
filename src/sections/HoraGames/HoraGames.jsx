            <p>To make this collection truly unique & a next-level experience, Blvck partnered up with Hora Games, who established themselves as one of the pioneers in the play-to-earn (P2E) gaming genre. Their project Crypto Idle Miner propelled them into a casual gaming sphere with a never-seen-before concept, rewarding players based on their leaderboard position. Hora Games is one of the first P2E companies that successfully launched their project on Google Play & App Store in 2019. Today, they have over 700,000 downloads on both platforms!</p>
            <p>Now, we are expanding their metaverse experience to include NFT playable content, making this collaboration even more innovative, exciting, and exclusive!</p>
